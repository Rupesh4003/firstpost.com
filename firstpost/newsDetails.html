        <h4>Pragraaj</h4><p> Uttar Pradesh Police on Wednesday arrested from Prayagraj the SHO accused of sexually assaulting a 13-year-old gang-rape victim in Lalitpur district.

            Prayagraj Additional Director General of Police Prem Prakash said SHO Tilakdhari Saroj was arrested from near the Allahabad High Court.
            
            The teen, allegedly raped by four men over three days, was sexually assaulted again by the SHO of the police station where she had been left by her attackers. ADGP Prakash said on a tip-off from his Kanpur counterpart, a police team was pressed into the service. They searched for him on the basis of his mobile phone location.
            
            He said the policeman was changing his mobile phone. First his location was traced to Banda, then Chitrakoot and finally in Prayagraj. After questioning a man close to him, the SHO was arrested from near the High Court there, he said.
            
            The ADGP said it appears that he was looking for some legal assistance. The SHO was handed over to the police team, which will bring him to Lalitpur. After his arrest, the SHO was heard saying on TV channels that he was innocent.
            
            He sought an impartial inquiry into the incident. Till now, police have arrested six people in the case, the chilling details of which emerged after the victim narrated her ordeal to an NGO, which approached the superintendent of police. Following his intervention, an FIR was registered on Tuesday.</p>
